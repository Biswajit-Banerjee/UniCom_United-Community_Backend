## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

In hard times like this, people must stand united and help each other in any manner possible to our survival. Since the cure is still under progress this situation is going to last long. Production of goods and raw materials has slowed down a lot. The people diagnosed with COVID-19 are fighting for their lives but they are not the only ones who are struggling to live in this pandemic situation. The daily lives of individuals changed drastically, gathering daily supplies, food, water, and medicines are rare. What we aim to achieve is to give the common folk a shared platform where they can look for help. People will be able to share resources, locate nearby helpful locations, provide support with ease.

Our web platform is a simple but powerful tool to connect the needy with their need.

    The idea is to make a common web platform bridge between Helper and Help Seeker’s. Ideas about this project arise because of the crisis in quarantine facilities available in our country.
    Government has been taking care of those people who are infected from COVID-19, and those people who are coming from outside of country government are providing isolation wards for them to get a better check-up. Even in many hotels and other places they are providing rooms for COVID -19 patients.
    Our web application can work as a common platform for imparting a simple managed workflow for giving easy access to the quarantine facility to the help seekers by helping them.

    Our Web are targeting two types of mass:-
        - Individual looking for self-quarantine
        - Hotels / Groceries / NGO’s / Individuals want to help those who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and self-quarantine individuals for quarantine facilities.
